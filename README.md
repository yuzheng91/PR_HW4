How to run my code and get my experiment result.
You can have an anaconda virtual environment.
I use vscode to edit my code.
If you want to train my code, you can type python training.py in the terminal.
If you want to get the prediction to the testing dataset, you need to put best.pth in the weights folder and type python inference.py in the terminal.
The weights folder is in my google drive. You can have it by searching https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VfKYOd0LfpbJxTdmbsroqVb5bSNvFOvS?usp=sharing.
The best.pth is inside the weights folder. However, you need to download the full folder to get the full prediction.
I use Nvidia 3060 to train my model in the local place.
